Simple Chat Implementation
This is a basic chat application implemented in Java using sockets. It consists of a server that listens for incoming connections from clients and handles messages sent by the clients. The clients can send messages to the server, and the server broadcasts those messages to all connected clients.

Features
Simple chat functionality with a server and multiple clients.
Real-time message broadcasting to all connected clients.
Threaded client handling for concurrent connections.

How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the Java files using your favorite Java compiler or an IDE.

    Copy code
    javac Server.java 
    javac Client.java

3. Start the server by running the Server class.

    Copy code
    java Server

4. Launch the client(s) by running the Client class.

    Copy code
    java Client
    You can run multiple clients simultaneously to test the chat functionality.

5. The server and clients should now be connected, and you can start sending and receiving messages in the chat.

Configuration
The default server port is set to 12345. You can change it in the Server.java file if needed.
